			<h1>About</h1>
			<p> I'm currently pursuing my Master’s in Systems Engineering at Cornell University, where I specialized in business systems. I'll working as a data support intern in the information technology sector, with research interests in AIGC empoers business. I’ve worked on a range of data-driven projects at the intersection of energy, machine learning, and forecasting. This includes developing a probabilistic LSTM model to predict solar electricity generation with uncertainty estimates, and implementing a CNN-based architecture for time series energy forecasting. I also led an analysis comparing AI-generated insights and expert opinions on energy R&D investments, and optimized large-scale matrix operations using parallel computing for simulation efficiency. I live in Ithaca NY, and I'll be in Shanghai during the summer. I like traveling, especially to cities by the sea, trying various musical instruments, and watching movies and plays.
